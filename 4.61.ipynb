    "\n",
    "Let $X \\in \\{0,1\\}$ be a random variable, that satisfies $$prob(X=1) = p = \\frac {exp(a^{T}x+b)}{1+exp(a^{T}x+b)} $$  where $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector of variables that affect the probability, and $a$ and $b$ are known parameters. We can think of $X = 1$ as the event that a consumer buys a product, and $x$ as a vector of variables that affect the probability, e.g., advertising effort, retail price, discounted price, packaging expense, and other factors. \n",
    "The variable $x$, which we are to optimize over, is subject to a set of linear constraints, $Fx \\preceq g$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formulate the following problems as convex optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1)  _Maximizing buying probability_ The goal is to choose $x$ to maximize $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)  _Maximizing expected profit._ Let $c^T x+d$ be the profit derived from selling the product, which we assume is positive for all feasible x. The goal is to maximize the expected profit, which is $p\\cdot(c^T x + d)$.  \n"
